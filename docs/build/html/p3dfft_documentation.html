<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>P3DFFT is a scalable software library implementing three-dimensional spectral transforms. It has been used in a variety of codes from many areas of computational science. It has been tested and used on many high-end computational system. It uses two-dimensional domain decomposition in order to overcome a scaling bottleneck of one-dimensional decomposition. This allows the programs with this library to scale well on a large number of cores, consistent with bisection bandwidth scaling of interconnect of the underlying hardware system.</p>
<p>Below are the main features of P3DFFT v. 2.7.5:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Real-to-complex and complex-to-real Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in 3D.</li>
<li>Cosine, sine, and combined Fourier-Chebyshev transform (FFT in 2D and Chebyshev in the third dimension). Alternatively users can substitute their own transform in the third dimension, for example a compact scheme.</li>
<li>Fortran and C interfaces</li>
<li>Built for performance at all ranges of core counts</li>
<li>Hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation</li>
<li>In-place and out-of-place transforms</li>
<li>Pruned transforms</li>
<li>Multivariable transforms</li>

<h2>5. Array Decomposition<a class="headerlink" href="#array-decomposition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The p3dfft_setup routine sets up the two-dimensional (2D) array decomposition. P3DFFT employs 2D block decomposition whereby processors are arranged into a 2D grid P1 x P2, based on their MPI rank. Two of the dimensions of the 3D grid are block-distributed across the processor grid, by assigning the blocks to tasks in the rank order. The third dimension of the grid remains undivided, i.e. contained entirely within local memory (see Fig. 1). This scheme is sometimes called pencils decomposition.</p>
<p>A block decomposition is defined by dimensions of the local portion of the array contained within each task, as well as the beginning and ending indices for each dimension defining the array’s location within the global array. This information is returned by p3dfft_get_dims routine which should be called before setting up the data structures of your program (see sample/ subdirectory for example programs).</p>
<p>In P3DFFT, the decompositions of the output and input arrays, while both being two-dimensional, differ from each other. The reason for this is as follows. In 3D Fourier Transform it is necessary to transpose the data a few times (two times for two-dimensional decomposition) in order to rearrange the data so as to always perform one-dimensional FFT on data local in memory of each processing element. It would be possible to transpose the data back to the original form after the 3D transform is done, however it often makes sense to save significant time by forgoing this final transpose. All the user has to do is to operate on the output array while keeping in mind that the data are in a transposed form. The backward (complex-to-real) transform takes the array in a transposed form and produces a real array in the original form. The rest of this section clarifies exactly the original and transposed form of the arrays.</p>
<p>Starting with v. 2.7.5 P3DFFT features optional hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation. In this case the MPI decomposition is the same as above, and each MPI task now has Nthr threads. This essentially implements 3D decomposition, however the results are global arrays (in the OpenMP sense) so they can be used either with multi- or single-threaded program. The number of threads is specified through the environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS.</p>

Usually this type of array is an input to real-to-complex (forward) transform and an output of complex-to-real (backward) transform. ip=2: &quot;Transposed&quot;: a &quot;wavenumber space&quot; array of complex numbers, local in Z, distributed among P1 tasks in X dimension, P2 tasks in Y dimension. Usually this type of array is an output of real-to- complex (forward) transform and an input to complex-to-real, backward transform. ip=3: the routine returns three numbers corresponding to &quot;padded&quot; dimensions in the physical space, i.e. an array with these dimensions will be large enough both for physical and wavenumber space.

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: the layout of the 2D processor grid on the physical network is dependent on the architecture and software of the particular system, and can have some impact on efficiency of communication. By default, rows have processors with adjacent task IDs (this corresponds to &quot;FORTRAN&quot; type ordering). This can be changed to &quot;C&quot; ordering (columns have adjacent task IDs) by building the library with -DDIMS_C preprocessor flag. The former way is recommended on most systems.</p>
<p>P3DFFT uses 2D block decomposition to assign local arrays for each task. In many cases decomposition will not be entirely even: some tasks will get more array elements than others. P3DFFT attempts to minimize load imbalance. For example is the grid dimensions are 128 x 256 x 256 and the processor grid is defined as 3x4, the original (ip=1) decomposition calls for splitting 256 elements in Y dimension into three processor row. P3DFFT in this case will break it up into pieces of 86, 85 and 85 elements. The transposed (ip=2) decomposition will have local arrays with X dimensions 22, 22 and 21 respectively for processor rows 1 through 3 (the sum of these numbers is 65=(Nx+2)/2 since these are now complex numbers instead of reals, and an extra mode for Nyquist frequency is needed – see Section 5 for an explanation).</p>
<p>It should be clear that the user’s choice of P1 and P2 can make a difference on how balanced is the decomposition. Obviously the greater load imbalance, the less performance can be expected.</p>
<p>Note: the two array types are distributed among processors in a different way from each other, but this does not automatically imply anything about the ordering of the elements in memory. Memory layout of the original (ip=1) array uses the “Fortran” ordering. For example, for an array A(lx,ly,lz) the index corresponding to lx runs fastest. Memory layout for the transposed (ip=2) array type depends on how the P3DFFT library was built. By default, it preserves the ordering of the real array, i.e. (X,Y,Z). However, in many cases it is advisable to have Z dimension contiguous, i.e. a memory layout (Z,Y,X). This can speed up some computations in the wavenumber space by improving cache utilization through spatial locality in Z, and also often results in better performance of P3DFFT transforms themselves. The (Z,Y,X) layout can be triggered by building the library with –DSTRIDE1 preprocessor flag in the makefile. For more information, see performance section below.</p>

<h2>6. Forward (real-to-complex) and backward (complex-to-real) 3D Fourier transforms<a class="headerlink" href="#forward-real-to-complex-and-backward-complex-to-real-3d-fourier-transforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>P3DFFT versions 2.7.1 and higher implement transforms for one or more than one independent arrays/variables simultaneously. An example of this is 3 components of a velocity field. Multivariable transforms achieve greater speed than single-variable transforms, especially for grids of smaller size, due to buffer aggregation in inter-processor exchanges.</p>
<p>Forward transform is implemented by the p3dfft_ftran_r2c subroutine using the following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-guess notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">p3dfft_ftran_r2c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">IN</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">OUT</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The input IN is an array of real numbers with dimensions defined by array type with ip=1 (see Table 2 above), with X dimension contained entirely within each task, and Y and Z dimensions distributed among P1 and P2 tasks correspondingly. The output OUT is an array of complex numbers with dimensions defined by array type with ip=2, i.e. Z dimension contained entirely, and X and Y dimensions distributed among P1 and P2 tasks respectively. The op argument is a 3- letter character string indicating the type of transform desired. Currently only Fourier transforms are supported in X and Y (denoted by symbol f) and the following transforms in Z:</p>

<p>Empty transform can be useful for someone implementing custom transform in Z dimension. Example: op=’ffc’ means Fourier transform in X and Y, and a cosine transform in Z. The DCT-I kind of transform is performed (DST-I for sine), the definition of which can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform#DCT-I">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform#DCT-I</a></p>
<p>Backward transform is implemented by the p3dfft_btran_c2r subroutine using the following format:</p>
<div class="highlight-guess notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">p3dfft_btran_c2r</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">IN</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">OUT</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The input IN is an array of complex numbers with dimensions defined by array type with ip=2 (see Table 2 above), i.e. Z dimension is contained entirely, and X and Y dimensions are distributed among P1 and P2 tasks correspondingly. The output OUT is an array of real numbers with dimensions defined by array type with ip=1, i.e. X dimension is contained entirely within each task, and Y and Z are dimensions distributed among P1 and P2 tasks respectively. The op argument is similar to forward transform, with the first character of the string being one of t,c,s,n or 0, and the second and third being f. Example: op=’nff’ means no operation in Z, backward Fourier transforms in Y and X.</p>

<h2>7. Complex array storage definition<a class="headerlink" href="#complex-array-storage-definition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since Fourier transform of a real function has the property of conjugate symmetry, only about half of the complex Fourier coefficients need to be kept. To be precise, if the input array has n real elements, Fourier coefficients F(k) for k=n/2+1,..,n can be dropped as they can be easily restored from the rest of the coefficients. This saves both memory and time. In this version we do not attempt to further pack the complex data. Therefore the output array for the forward transform (and the input array of the backward transform) contains (Nx/2+1) times Ny times Nz complex numbers, with the understanding that Nx/2-1 elements in X direction are missing and can be restored from the remaining elements. As mentioned above, the Nx/2+1 elements in the X direction are distributed among P1 tasks in the transposed layout.</p>

<h2>8. Multivariable transforms<a class="headerlink" href="#multivariable-transforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometime communication performance of transposes such as those included in P3DFFT can be improved by combining several transforms into a single operation. (This allows us to aggregate messages during interprocessor data exchange). This is especially important when transforming small grids and/or when using systems with high interconnect latencies. P3DFFT provides multivariable transforms to make use of this idea. Instead of an 3D array as input parameter these subroutines accept a 4D array, with the extra dimension being the index of independent variables to be transformed (for example this could be 3 velocity components). The following is the syntax for multivariable transforms:</p>
<div class="highlight-guess notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">p3dfft_ftran_many_r2c</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">IN</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">dim_in</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="k">OUT</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">dim_out</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">nv</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">)</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The multivariable transform routines for both forward and backward transforms have an additional argument nv (integer) representing the number of independent variables in the input/output arrays. The spacing between these independent variables is defined by dim_in and dim_out (integer) arguments for input/output arrays respectively. Both dim_in and dim_out should not be less than the size of the grid returned by get_dims routine. See sample program driver_sine_many.F90, driver_sine_inplace_many.F90 or driver_rand_many for an example of such use.</p>

<div class="section" id="pruned-transforms">
<h2>9. Pruned transforms<a class="headerlink" href="#pruned-transforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes only a subset of output modes is needed to be retained (for forward transform), or a subset of input modes is used, the rest being zeros (for backward transform). Such transforms are called pruned transforms. Leaving off redundant modes can lead to significant savings of time and memory. The reduced dimensions Nx_cut,Ny_cut and Nz_cut are arguments to p3dfft_setup. By default they are equal to Nx,Ny,Nz. If they are different from the above (smaller) the output of forward transforms will be reduced in size correspondingly. The input for backward transform will also be smaller in size. It will be automatically padded with zeros until it reaches Nx,Ny,Nz.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="in-place-transforms">
<h2>10. In-place transforms<a class="headerlink" href="#in-place-transforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In and Out arrays can occupy the same space in memory (in-place transform). In this case, it is necessary to make sure that they start in the same location, otherwise the results are unpredictable. Also it is important to remember that the sizes of input and output arrays in general are not equal. The complex array is usually bigger since it contains the Nyquist frequency mode in X direction, in addition to the Nx/2 modes that equal in space to Nx real numbers. However when decomposition is not even, sometimes the real array can be bigger than the complex one, depending on the task ID. Therefore to be safe one must make sure the common-space array is large enough for both input and output. This can be done by using memsize argument when calling p3dfft_setup. It returns the maximum array size for both input and output. Alternatively, one can call p3dfft_get_dims two times with ip=1 and 2.</p>
<p>In Fortran using in-place transforms is a bit tricky due to language restrictions on subroutine argument types (i.e., one of the arrays is expected to be real and the other complex). In order to overcome this problem wrapper routines are provided, named ftran_r2c and btran_c2r respectively for forward and backward transform (without p3dfft prefix). There are examples for such in-place transform in the sample/ subdirectory. These wrappers can be also used for out-of-place transforms just as well.</p>

<h2>12. Performance considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>P3DFFT was created to compute 3D FFT in parallel with high efficiency. In particular it is aimed for applications where the data volume is large. It is especially useful when running applications on ultra-scale parallel platforms where one-dimensional decomposition is not adequate. Since P3DFFT was designed to be portable, no effort is made to do architecture-specific optimization. However, the user is given some choices in setting up the library, mentioned below, that may affect performance on a given system. Current version of P3DFFT uses ESSL or FFTW library for it 1D FFT routines. ESSL [1] provides FFT routines highly optimized for IBM platforms it is built on. The FFTW [2], while being generic, also makes an effort to maximize performance on many kinds of architectures. Some performance data will be uploaded at the P3DFFT Web site. For more questions and comments please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:dmitry&#37;&#52;&#48;sdsc&#46;edu">dmitry<span>&#64;</span>sdsc<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>.</p>
<p>Optimal performance on many parallel platforms for a given number of cores and problem size will likely depend on the choice of processor decomposition. For example, given a processor grid P1 x P2 (specified in the first argument to p3dfft_setup) performance will generally be better with smaller P1 (with the product P1 x P2 kept constant). Ideally P1 will be equal or less than the number of cores on an SMP node or a multi-core chip. In addition, the closer a decomposition is to being even, the better load balancing.</p>
<p>Beginning with v.2.7.5 P3DFFT is equipped with MPI/OpenMP capability. If use of this feature is needed simply set the desired number of threads through environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS. The optimal number of threads, just like the processor grid, depends on specific platform and problem.</p>
<p>Performance is likely to be better when P3DFFT is built using --enable-stride1 during configure. This implies stride-1 data ordering for FFTs. Note that using this argument changes the memory layout of the transposed array (see section 3 for explanation). To help tune performance further, two more arguments can be used: --enable-dnblx=… and --enable-dnbly=…, which define block sizes in X and Y when doing local array reordering. Choosing suitable block sizes allows the program to optimize cache performance, although by default P3DFFT chooses these values based on a good guess according to cache size.</p>
<p>Finally, performance will be better if overwrite parameter is set to .true. (or 1 in C) when initializing P3DFFT. This allows the library to overwrite the input array, which results in significantly faster execution when not using the --enable-stride1 argument.</p>
