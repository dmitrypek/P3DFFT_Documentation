        "test_trans1D.c", "Test program for real-to-complex and complex-to-real 1D FFT. User can choose an arbitrary dimension of transform. This function performs a local transpose in addition to 1D FFT, as needed. The transpose is specified by input and output memory order, which maps logical onto storage array dimensions. No inter-processor transpose takes place here. 1D transforms can be used by themselves or as a stage in a multidimensional transform."
