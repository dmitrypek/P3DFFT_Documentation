        ":download:`test1D_cos.C <../../downloadable/sample/C++/test1D_cos.C>`", "This program exemplifies the use of 1D transforms in P3DFFT++, using cosine 1D transform (DCT-1), for real-valued arrays. 1D transforms are performed on 3D arrays, in the dimension specified as an argument. This could be an isolated 1D transform or a stage in a multidimensional transform. This function can do local transposition, i.e. arbitrary input and output memory ordering. However it does not do an inter-processor transpose (see test_transMPI for that)."

This could be an isolated 1D transform or a stage in a multidimensional transform. This function can do local transposition, i.e. arbitrary input and output memory ordering.

This is an in-place transform example (output overwrites input, which is in the same array)."

This is a single precision version of test3D_r2c.C example."
