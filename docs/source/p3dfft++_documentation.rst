P3DFFT++ Documentation
======================
The new generation of P3DFFT library (dubbed P3DFFT++ or P3DFFT v.3) is a generalization of the concept of P3DFFT for more arbitrary data formats and transform functions. It is now in beta testing and is available from its github page. Language-specific reference is provided in Tutorial as well as in separate Reference documents (see C++, C and Fortran).
