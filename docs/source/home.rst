Open Source Numerical Library for Scalable Multidimensional Fourier Transforms and related algorithms
=======================================================================================================

This site provides tools for solution of numerical problems in multiscale phenomena in three dimensions (3D). The most common example of such problem is Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which is an important algorithm for simulations in a wide range of fields, including studies of turbulence, climatology, astrophysics and material science. Other algorithms of importance include Chebyshev transforms and high-order finite difference compact schemes.

Parallel Three-Dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms, dubbed P3DFFT, as well as its extension P3DFFT++, is a library for large-scale computer simulations on parallel platforms.This project was initiated at San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UC San Diego by its main author Dmitry Pekurovsky, Ph.D.

This library uses 2D, or pencil, decomposition. This overcomes an important limitation to scalability inherent in FFT libraries implementing 1D (or slab) decomposition: the number of processors/tasks used to run this problem in parallel can be as large as N2, where N is the linear problem size. This approach has shown good scalability up to 524,288 cores.

**P3DFFT**

P3DFFT is written in Fortran90 and is optimized for parallel performance. It uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) for interprocessor communication, and starting from v.2.7.5 there is a multithreading option for hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation. C/C++ interface is available, as are detailed documentation and examples in both Fortran and C. A configure script is supplied for ease of installation. This package depends on a serial FFT library such as Fastest Fourier Transform in the West (`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_) or IBM's `ESSL <http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/am501405.pdf>`_. The library is available from its `github page <https://github.com/sdsc/p3dfft>`_.

**P3DFFT++**

P3DFFT++ is the next generation of P3DFFT (versions starting with 3.0). It extends the interface of P3DFFT to allow a wider range of use scenarios. It provides the user with a choice in defining their own data layout formats beyond the predefined 2D pencil blocks. It is written in C++ with C and Fortran interfaces, and currently uses MPI. The library can be found at P3DFFT++ `github space <https://github.com/sdsc/p3dfft.3>`_. See P3DFFT++ Tutorial and P3DFFT++ reference pages in C++, C and Fortran.

The following table compares P3DFFT family 2.7.6 and 3.1.0 (P3DFFT++).
